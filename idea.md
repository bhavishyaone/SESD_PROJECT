# Learning Management System (LMS)

## 1. Introduction

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a structured digital platform designed to manage, deliver, and track educational content and academic activities. With the increasing demand for online education and hybrid learning environments, institutions and instructors require organized systems to efficiently manage courses, assignments, and student performance.

This project aims to design and develop a role-based Learning Management System that provides a scalable and structured environment for course delivery, user management, and performance tracking.

## 2. Problem Statement

Modern education increasingly relies on digital platforms; however, many existing solutions are either overly complex or lack structured organization. Common challenges include:

- Poorly structured course content
- Limited student progress tracking
- Inefficient assignment and grading workflows
- Lack of clearly defined user roles
- Difficulty in maintaining scalability and clarity

There is a need for a well-defined system that ensures structured course hierarchy, proper role-based responsibilities, and efficient management of academic activities.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a structured, role-based Learning Management System that supports organized digital learning.

The system will provide:

- A clear separation of user roles (Student, Instructor, Admin)
- Structured course organization using a hierarchical model
- Efficient enrollment and progress tracking
- Assignment submission and grading mechanisms
- Certificate generation upon successful completion

The system is designed to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability while supporting real-world academic workflows.
